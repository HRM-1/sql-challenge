# EmployeeSQL
This code comprises six databases: departments, dept_emp, dept_manager, employees, salaries, and titles. The task involves creating a diagram that illustrates the relationships among these various tables using QuickDBD (output attached). The objective was to produce multiple tables that consolidate information from different tables, revealing the department assignments of employees, the time of their hiring and the corresponding managers for different departments. The repository includes the diagram, the export file from it, and the SQL code.
